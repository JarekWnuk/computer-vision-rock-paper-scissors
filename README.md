Project will use the teachable machine deep learing model from Google. The model will collect data from the video camera and, when trained, detect the shown hand.
Class for each option (rock, paper, scissors or nothing) has been created and camera images collected. The number of images for each hand exceeds 100 and includes images of hands up close
and further away.
Model trained, files keras_model.h5 and labels.txt downloaded.
